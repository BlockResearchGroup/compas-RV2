The RhinocerosÂ® Plug-In RhinoVAULT emerged from research on structural form finding using the Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) approach to intuitively create and explore compression-only structures [1]_.

Using reciprocal diagrams, RhinoVAULT provides an intuitive, fast funicular form-finding method, adopting the same advantages of techniques such as Graphic Statics, but offering a viable extension to fully three-dimensional problems. Our goal is to share key aspects of our research in a comprehensible and transparent setup to let you not only create beautiful shapes but also to give you an understanding of the underlying structural principles.

"The resistant virtues of the structure that we seek depend on their form; it is through their form that they are stable, not because of an awkward accumulation of material. There is nothing more noble and elegant from an intellectual viewpoint than this: to resist through form." - Eladio Dieste, 1996.

Recognition
-----------

In 2014, RhinoVAULT was awarded in the category 'Structure / Physics _ Formation' at ALGODeQ, an international competition for algorithmic design programs, furthermore receiving the highest rating from the reviewers.
