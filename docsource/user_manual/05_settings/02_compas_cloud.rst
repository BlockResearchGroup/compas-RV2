compas_cloud
============

**compas_cloud** is an essential infrastructure component used by RV2.
It runs a background server for executing highly efficient numerical algorithms from CPython packges such as **numpy** and **scipy** that are not compatible with IronPython that runs inside Rhino.
This allows RV2 to utilise full capacity of other compas packages such as **compas_tna** and **compas_triangle** which has CPython dependencies.
compas_cloud server communicates with Rhino through websocket protocol, and can be controlled from RV2 menu:
